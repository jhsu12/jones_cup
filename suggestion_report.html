        summary: "A fast-paced, perimeter-oriented team. Their offense is heavily reliant on the three-point shooting of Curry and Thompson. Defensively, they are solid but can be vulnerable to teams that control the paint.",
        offense: `
            <p><strong>Primary Style:</strong> Motion offense, lots of off-ball screens and cutting. They look to create open threes in transition and early in the shot clock.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Plays:</strong> High pick-and-roll with Curry as the ball-handler. Split cuts and flare screens for Thompson. Green often acts as a facilitator from the high post.</p>
            <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Elite three-point shooting, high offensive rating, good ball movement.</p>
            <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Can be turnover-prone. Live-ball turnovers lead to easy transition points for the opponent. They can struggle if their threes aren't falling.</p>
        `,
        defense: `
            <p><strong>Primary Scheme:</strong> Switching defense, especially on the perimeter. They aim to contest all shots and force turnovers.</p>
            <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Good at defending the three-point line. Green is an excellent help defender and communicator.</p>
            <p><strong>Vulnerabilities:</strong> Can be outrebounded. Teams with dominant post players can find success inside. Their switching scheme can sometimes lead to mismatches.</p>
        `,
        matchups: `
            <p><strong>vs. Curry:</strong> Fight over screens, don't switch. Trap him in pick-and-roll situations to get the ball out of his hands. Be physical and deny him the ball.</p>
            <p><strong>vs. Thompson:</strong> Stay attached to him at all times. Don't help off him to double-team others. Make him put the ball on the floor.</p>
            <p><strong>General Game Plan:</strong> Slow the pace down. Attack the paint and force their bigs to defend. Crash the offensive glass. Make them work on defense and run them off the three-point line.</p>

        offense: "<p><strong>Primary Style:</strong> Isolation and pick-and-roll heavy. They rely on Leonard and George to create their own shots.</p><p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Elite one-on-one scorers. Good mid-range game. They don't turn the ball over much.</p><p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Can become predictable and stagnant. Ball movement can suffer. Less effective when their stars are on the bench.</p>",
        defense: "<p><strong>Primary Scheme:</strong> Man-to-man defense with a focus on individual matchups. They have versatile defenders who can switch multiple positions.</p><p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Excellent perimeter defense. Can lock down opposing star players.</p><p><strong>Vulnerabilities:</strong> Can be susceptible to teams with good ball movement and off-ball action. May struggle against teams with a dominant big man.</p>",
        matchups: "<p><strong>vs. Leonard/George:</strong> Make them work for their shots. Force them to their weak hand. Send help, but be smart about it to avoid giving up open threes.</p><p><strong>General Game Plan:</strong> Move the ball and make them defend multiple actions. Attack the basket and try to draw fouls. Push the pace in transition before their defense can get set.</p>"

        pace: 103.1,
        summary: "A young, athletic team that loves to run in transition. Their offense is built around SGA's driving ability. They are an aggressive, opportunistic defensive team.",
        offense: "<p><strong>Primary Style:</strong> Transition and drive-and-kick. SGA is the primary initiator, constantly probing the defense.</p><p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Elite at getting to the rim and drawing fouls. They play at a high pace and can score in bunches.</p><p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Inconsistent outside shooting. Can be turnover-prone due to their aggressive style.</p>",
        defense: "<p><strong>Primary Scheme:</strong> Aggressive, high-pressure defense. They look to force turnovers and get out in transition.</p><p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Good at creating steals and deflections. They have long, athletic defenders.</p><p><strong>Vulnerabilities:</strong> Can be foul-prone. Their aggressiveness can be used against them with good fakes and ball movement. Can give up open shots if their rotations are late.</p>",
        matchups: "<p><strong>vs. SGA:</strong> Keep him out of the paint. Force him to be a jump shooter. Send help at the rim, but be ready to rotate to shooters.</p><p><strong>General Game Plan:</strong> Take care of the ball. Make them play in the half-court. Attack their aggressive defense with back-cuts and screens. Exploit their lack of size in the frontcourt.</p>"

        summary: "A well-rounded team with two-way star power on the wings. They are one of the best defensive teams in the league and have a versatile offense.",
        offense: "<p><strong>Primary Style:</strong> A mix of pick-and-roll and isolation, with Tatum and Brown as the primary creators. They have good spacing with shooters around their stars.</p><p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Elite wing scoring. Good three-point shooting. Can score from all three levels.</p><p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Can sometimes settle for tough, contested shots. Their offense can become stagnant if the ball isn't moving.</p>",
        defense: "<p><strong>Primary Scheme:</strong> Elite switching defense. They have versatile defenders at almost every position and can shut down opposing offenses.</p><p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Top-tier defense. They protect the rim well and contest everything on the perimeter.</p><p><strong>Vulnerabilities:</strong> Not many obvious weaknesses. The best way to attack them is with crisp ball movement and by trying to create mismatches before their help defense can recover.</p>",
        matchups: "<p><strong>vs. Tatum/Brown:</strong> A team effort is required. Make them see multiple bodies. Try to force them into tough, contested mid-range shots.</p><p><strong>General Game Plan:</strong> Be patient on offense. Move the ball and hunt for the best possible shot. Try to get them in foul trouble. Be prepared for a physical, low-scoring game.</p>"

        offense: "<p><strong>Primary Style:</strong> Transition offense initiated by James. In the half-court, they look to post up James or Davis and play off of them.</p><p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Dominant in the paint. They get to the free-throw line a lot. James is an elite playmaker.</p><p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Inconsistent outside shooting. Their offense can struggle when James is on the bench.</p>",
        defense: "<p><strong>Primary Scheme:</strong> Drop coverage with Davis protecting the rim. They try to funnel everything towards their bigs.</p><p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Excellent rim protection. They are a good rebounding team.</p><p><strong>Vulnerabilities:</strong> Can be vulnerable to pick-and-pop bigs and teams that shoot the three well. Their perimeter defense can be exploited.</p>",
        matchups: "<p><strong>vs. James:</strong> Give him space and make him a jump shooter. Go under screens. Keep him out of the paint.</p><p><strong>vs. Davis:</strong> Be physical with him. Try to draw him away from the basket on defense. Use a team effort to box him out.</p><p><strong>General Game Plan:</strong> Push the pace and try to score before their defense is set. Shoot a lot of threes. Use a smaller, quicker lineup to try and exploit their lack of perimeter speed.</p>"
